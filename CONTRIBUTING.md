Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to Autofactory you can do so through GitHub
by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.  

Where appropriate, please provide unit tests or integration tests. Unit tests
should be JUnit based tests and can use either standard JUnit assertions or
Truth assertions and be added to `<project>/src/test/java`.  Changes to 
code generation or other build-time behaviour should go into small maven 
projects using the `maven-invoker-plugin`.  Examples of this are in
`generator/src/it` and can include bean-shell verification scripts and other
facilities provided by `maven-invoker-plugin`.

Please make sure your code compiles by running `mvn clean verify` which will
execute both unit and integration test phases.  Additionally, consider using 
http://travis-ci.org to validate your branches before you even put them into
pull requests.  All pull requests will be validated by Travis-ci in any case
and must pass before being merged.

If you are adding or modifying files you may add your own copyright line, but
please ensure that the form is consistent with the existing files, and please
note that a Google, Inc. copyright line must appear in every copyright notice.
All files are released with the Apache 2.0 license and any new files may only
be accepted under the terms of that license.

Checkstyle failures during compilation indicate errors in your style and will
be displayed in the console output of the build (including in Travis-CI output),
or can be viewed in the `checkstyle-result.xml` file.  To save yourself some
hassle, consider executing checkstyle first per: 'mvn checkstyle:checkstyle'.
It's fast, and will catch style errors early.

Before your code can be accepted into the project you must sign the
[Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][1].
