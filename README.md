# Auto

A collection of source code generators for [Java][java].

## Autoâ€½

[Java][java] is full of code that is mechanical, repetitive, typically untested
and sometimes the source of subtle bugs. _Sounds like a job for robots!_

The Auto subprojects are a collection of code generators that automate those
types of tasks. They create the code you would have written, but without
the bugs.

Save time.  Save code.  Save sanity.

    Latest version: `0.1-beta3`

  * [AutoService] - Provider-configuration files for [`ServiceLoader`]
