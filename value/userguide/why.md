# Why use AutoValue?


AutoValue is the only solution to the value class problem in Java having all of
the following characteristics:

*   **API-invisible** (callers cannot become dependent on your choice to use it)
*   No runtime dependencies
*   Negligible cost to performance
*   Very few limitations on what your class can do
*   Extralinguistic "magic" kept to an absolute minimum (uses only standard Java
    platform technologies, in the manner they were intended)

This [slide presentation] compares AutoValue to numerous alternatives
and explains why we think it is better.
