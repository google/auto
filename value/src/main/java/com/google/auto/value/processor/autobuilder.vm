## Template for each generated AutoBuilder_Foo class.
## This template uses the Apache Velocity Template Language (VTL).
## The variables ($pkg, $props, and so on) are defined by the fields of AutoBuilderTemplateVars.
##
## Comments, like this one, begin with ##. The comment text extends up to and including the newline
## character at the end of the line. So comments also serve to join a line to the next one.
## Velocity deletes a newline after a directive (#if, #foreach, #end etc) so ## is not needed there.
## That does mean that we sometimes need an extra blank line after such a directive.
##
## Post-processing will remove unwanted spaces and blank lines, but will not join two lines.
## It will also replace classes spelled as (e.g.) `java.util.Arrays`, with the backquotes, to
## use just Arrays if that class can be imported unambiguously, or java.util.Arrays if not.

#if (!$pkg.empty)
package $pkg;
#end

## The following line will be replaced by the required imports during post-processing.
`import`

#if (!$generated.empty)
@${generated}("com.google.auto.value.processor.AutoBuilderProcessor")
#else
// Generated by com.google.auto.value.processor.AutoBuilderProcessor
#end
#set($autoBuilder = true)
#parse("builder.vm")
