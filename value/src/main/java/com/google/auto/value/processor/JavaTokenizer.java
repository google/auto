 * is syntactically correct because the annotation processor won't run otherwise. It makes no effort
 * to account for Unicode escapes like {@code \}{@code u1234} but it is hard to imagine that
 * mattering. It also makes no effort to account for surrogate pairs, but again unless someone is
 * using such a pair in the name of one of the abstract methods we are looking for that should not
