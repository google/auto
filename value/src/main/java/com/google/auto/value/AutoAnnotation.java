/**
 * Annotation that causes an implementation of an annotation interface to be generated. The
 * annotation is applied to a method whose return type is an annotation interface. The method can
 * then create and return an instance of the generated class that conforms to the specification of
 * {@link Annotation}, in particular as regards {@link Annotation#equals equals} and {@link
 * Annotation#hashCode hashCode}. These instances behave essentially the same as instances returned
 * by {@link AnnotatedElement#getAnnotation}.
 *
 * <p>For example, suppose you have an annotation like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 * package com.google.inject.name;
 *
 * public &#64;interface Named {
 *   String value();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>You could write a method like this to construct implementations of the interface:
 *
 * <pre>
 * package com.example;
 *
 * public class Names {
 *   &#64;AutoAnnotation public static Named named(String value) {
 *     return new AutoAnnotation_Names_named(value);
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Because the annotated method is called {@code Names.named}, the generated class is called
 * {@code AutoAnnotation_Names_named} in the same package. If the annotated method were in a nested
 * class, for example {@code Outer.Names.named}, then the generated class would be called {@code
 * AutoAnnotation_Outer_Names_named}. The generated class is package-private and it is not expected
 * that it will be referenced outside the {@code @AutoAnnotation} method.
 *
 * <p>The names and types of the parameters in the annotated method must be the same as the names
 * and types of the annotation elements, except that elements which have default values can be
 * omitted. The parameters do not need to be in any particular order.
 *
 * <p>The annotated method does not need to be public. It can have any visibility, including
 * private. This means the method can be a private implementation called by a public method with a
 * different API, for example using a builder.
 *
 * <p>It is a compile-time error if more than one method with the same name in the same class is
 * annotated {@code @AutoAnnotation}.
 *
 * <p>The constructor of the generated class has the same parameters as the {@code @AutoAnnotation}
 * method. It will throw {@code NullPointerException} if any parameter is null. In order to
 * guarantee that the constructed object is immutable, the constructor will clone each array
 * parameter corresponding to an array-valued annotation member, and the implementation of each such
 * member will also return a clone of the array.
